# Machine-Learning-Project
Group Project - Analyzing Drug Orchestra Project
We perform 6 models compared to the Drug Orchestra model: Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN Classification, Decision Tree and Gradient boosting.
We run it on Jupyter notebook. Just need to modify the path of the datasets.
